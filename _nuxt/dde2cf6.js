The truck serves many locations throughout central Florida and catered special events.</p>\n<h3>What I worked on</h3>\n<p>Food trucks have been around for a long time, but the Feast Beast was born out of a bit of a trending food truck craze that took hold of Central Florida. New trucks were popping up left and right.</p>\n<p>Events often host large groups of trucks, all competing over the same customers. This is great for business, but harsh competition. Success demands on standing out from the pack.</p>\n<p>For a food truck, the truck is the brand. When a person gazes across a fleet of options, deciding which line they want to stand in, the visual appearance of the truck is the first opportunity to land a sale.</p>\n<p>The client wanted to drill down into the essence of the “feast beast” name,  which mostly called to the fierce hunger of their customers, but we decided the truck itself could personify THE Feast Beast.</p>\n<photoswipe-gallery :singleImage="true">\n  <photoswipe-image\n    imageURL="projects/feastbeast/feastbeast--ref.jpg"\n    :classes="\'large\'"\n    :caption="\'Some reference photos used to influence the mood and styling of the brand\'" />\n</photoswipe-gallery>\n<h3>Some detailed challenges</h3>\n<h4>“Measure twice, print once”</h4>\n<p>I was used to working with standardized paper sizes and even large-format posters and banners, but there’s nothing standard in measurement, with a nearly twenty five feet long box truck.</p>\n<p>For the sign-companies that deal with this on a regular basis, there’s packages of digital template files for common vehicle makes and models, but they’re often costly (sold as bundles) and I wasn’t able to find one with this particular vehicle.</p>\n<p>The best option was to just get out there with a tape measure and go to work. I also had to account for additional modifications and mountings that would be added, like cut-out openings, generators and propane tanks.

Machines are calibrated as best as possible, but perfection is near impossible with moving parts. So that variance has to be allotted for in design.</p>\n<p>In the case of vehicle wraps, they’re essentially printed as posters and applied in sheets, carefully aligned with each other. It was important to build in some strategic wiggle room and minimise the risk of having vital elements (like text) land in areas with dangerous protrusions or seams.</p>\n<photoswipe-gallery :singleImage="true">\n  <div class="grid-item large">\n    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lG0juIfuY_I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>\n</photoswipe-gallery>\n<h4>Designing at LARGE scale</h4>\n<p>If you view a newspaper through a magnifying glass, you’ll find small dots of ink called halftones. Like looking closely at an old TV, with tiny lines of red, green, and blue, printers also mix dots of color to form images.</p>\n<p>Things printed at large scales, like billboards, are mostly printed at low resolution, which means there’s much fewer and often larger dots-per-inch. If you view them up-close, you wouldn’t need a magnifying glass to see the dots. They’d look grainy, pixelated and low quality. But from far away, the image looks perfectly good.</p>\n<p>This often makes for an easier design process and reduced printing costs. But in the case of the Feast Beast, we were able to take advantage of the printers high resolution to make the design appear much cleaner and crisper compared to the competitor’s trucks, with typically low resolution designs. One more chance to stand out...</p>\n<p>But, I’d never worked with 25 ft. wide HD  files. I work on a custom built, powerful computer, but file sizes that large pushed even it’s limits to be virtually unusable.</p>\n<p>The solution was to scale everything down to one/tenth the physical size, but at a 10x resolution. Adobe Photoshop processes these files much more smoothly. Then they had to be scaled back up, and have their resolution reduced back to normal before printing.</p>\n<h3>Website</h3>\n<p>The concept for the website was to build it with WordPress, and utilize a combination of plugins and features that would create a user-friendly, but powerful tool for the client:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress’ official mobile app would enable the client to publish new content while on the move, from their phone, without needing a computer or internet.</li>\n<li>A geo-tagging plugin, that detected the devices location to include in posts, for when the truck serves food from impromptu locations.</li>\n<li>A few different role and administration plugins, to hide most of the unnecessary admin interface to reduce the appearance of complexity to the client.</li>\n<li>A calendar plugin that hooked in to a Facebook API and automatically imported Facebook events, allowing the client to keep their event management in one central location.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initial testing of all these features worked, but the truck was sold to a new out-of-state owner before the website was completed and the project was cancelled.
