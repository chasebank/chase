###About FeastBeast
FeastBeast mobile food truck in Orlando, Florida, featuring original gourmet dishes by Chef Frank Van Marlen, and inspired by authentic Brazilian culture.

###Project Overview
Create a brand that's recognizably unique enough to stand out from the pack, in a rapidly growing and saturated market of competitors. The band needed to be rooted in a foundation that was the truck itself, and then applied throughout all supporting materials.
