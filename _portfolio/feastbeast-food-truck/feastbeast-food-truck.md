###About FeastBeast
FeastBeast is a mobile food truck serving Orlando, Florida. Featuring gourmet dishes prepared by Chef Frank Van Marlen, and inspired by authentic Brazilian culture and cuisine.

###Project Overview
Create a brand that's recognizably unique enough to stand out from the pack, in a rapidly growing and saturated market of competitors. The brand needed to be rooted in a foundation that was the truck itself, and then built upon from there. While the name "FeastBeast" spoke to satisfying the fierce hunger of their customers, the central idea behind the brand became giving the truck a literal identity, as the personified "FeastBeast".

###Challenges
####Stand out.
"Branding" can be an overly generalized clich√© in design. But when the majority of business will come from food truck events, where all competition is present and competing, presentation really is everything. It was important to create an easily recognizable identity. Whether seeing the truck parked at an event, driving on the streets, or mentioned on social media (where most of the marketing engagement would take place) - FeastBeast needed to stand out.

####Designing around the intricacies of a large vehicle can be a challenge.
Taking detailed and accurate measurements were vital, along with accounting for obstructions such as lights, doors and windows. It helped working closely with the sign company that would be printing and applying the final vehicle wrap. At over 23 feet long and nearly 8 feet wide, working in high resolutions at these sizes can be taxing on even high-end computers. But it's important to not not sacrifice quality, and maximize the capabilities of a printer. To conserve computing resources, it helps to work with artwork scaled down to smaller physical sizes, but higher resolutions. This adds to the complexity of the measurements though, and needs readjusted before hand off to the printer.
