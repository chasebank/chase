###About the PGA
The Professional Golferâ€™s Association of America (PGA) is the largest working sports organization in the world, comprised of more than 27,000 dedicated men and women promoting the game of golf to everyone, everywhere.

###Project Overview
Design a holiday card that captures both the spirits of golf and the holidays. My idea was to show a golf scene under a light winter. The holidays are a time to enjoy the things you love with the ones you love - in this case, playing golf (come rain or shine, or even snow...)

###Challenges
I wasn't able to find a stock photo capturing this idea, so the challenge was set to make one, using a composite of multiple photos. This also included imposing the PGA emblem on a golf ball, indended for the main focal point.
