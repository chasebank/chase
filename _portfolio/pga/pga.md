###About the PGA
The Professional Golferâ€™s Association of America (PGA) is the largest working sports organization in the world, comprised of more than 27,000 dedicated supporters promoting the game of golf to everyone, everywhere.

###Project Overview
Design a holiday card that captures the spirits of enjoying both golf and the holidays. My concept was to show a golf scene under a light winter's snow. The holidays are a time to enjoy the things you love with the ones you love - in this case, playing golf (come rain or shine, or even snow...).

###Challenges
To fully capture the golf 'winter wonderland' scene that was pictured in my mind, a full photo composite was needed. Various elements were combined from 4 primary stock photos to create the final scene and mood. This also included realisticly imposing the PGA logo onto a golf ball, indended for the main focal point.
