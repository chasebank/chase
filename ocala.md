###Ocala - Guns, Fire, Food, Meteor Shower, Stargazing, Alcohol, Beerpong...
_What could possibly go wrong?_

We have two main groups going separately. One will leave in the morning, the other will leave mid afternoon.

The first group will hit up a Walmart for some supplies, around 10AM, then head to the gun range to stake out a spot. The second group will hit the road around 2pm, also do a Walmart run to fill the gaps, then meet at the range.

When there's nothing left to shoot, we'll head over to the camp site.

Some stragglers will probably show up separately later on, but if you want to car pool or follow someone - catch one of those two groups.

####Post a comment to help us make some plans:

* Are you definitely going? maybe? definitely not?
* Are you staying the whole night or leaving at some point?
* What useful supplies can you bring?
