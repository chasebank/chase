One of my favorite movies, and the book matched expectations. It's a very realistic and practical look at how "first contact" with alien intelligence would play out. I was surprised that the most compelling and significant surprise in the movie, played little roll in the book, while the movie essentially left out the entire climax of the story, which had astronomically larger implications for life it'self. Great read!
