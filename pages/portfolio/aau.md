### About The AAU
The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) was founded in 1888 and pioneered standards and uniformity in amateur sports.

With nearly 700,000 members and 150,000 volunteers, they support sports organizations throughout the United States, starting at a local grass roots level.

### What I worked on
Visual styles associated with common sports brands (Nike, Gatorade, ESPN) have a dramatic, extreme aesthetic. This fits the competitive nature of sports, pushing through boundaries to achieve greatness.

EXAMPLE STYLES REF

AAU is an "amateur" league, but I wanted to create designs that share that recognizable “big league” style.

I started with working to modernize the main AAU brand, representing the central organization.

I also created "hero images" to represent each of the many different sports. Those images were originally designed as large posters, but were then adapted as a sort of theme to apply in other formats, such as fliers, tri-fold brochures and booklets. Each matching a consistent design for that individual sport.

### Some more details
While AAU is a central support organization, independent teams and leagues spread throughout the entire United States. These affiliates have a wide variety of marketing needs ranging from events and tournaments, fundraising, recruitment, and community building.

My task was to design items that could be uniformly adapted for all use cases. Rather than limit usefulness with generic “one size fits all” designs and verbiage, we developed variable text fields that could be customized, through an online ordering platform, for each unique need.

This included things with simple headings and personal contact info, like is found on business cards, stationary, or large text on posters. Items with entire bodies of text could also be custom ordered, like flyers, brochures and rule books. test
